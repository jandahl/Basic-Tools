## Basic Tools
 Basic Tools that should make your life easier

 Usually there's a help/usage screen if you run them without parameters.

### `multitester.sh`
 Tool that `ping`s, `curl`s and `netcat`s the target domain or IPv4 IP. No consideration made for IPv6, currently.

### ottomator.sh
 Script that uses [`clogin`](https://www.systutorials.com/docs/linux/man/1-clogin/) from [Shrubbery Networks' `rancid`](https://www.shrubbery.net/rancid/) to throw a bunch of commands to a bunch of devices based on filenames. Very simple.
